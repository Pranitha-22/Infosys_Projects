## ðŸŽ¨ Project 1: Conditional GAN using CIFAR-10

### ðŸ“Œ Objective
Train a Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CGAN) on the CIFAR-10 dataset to generate fake images conditioned on user-specified class labels.

### ðŸ“Š Dataset: CIFAR-10
- 60,000 RGB images (32x32 pixels)
- 10 classes: `airplane`, `automobile`, `bird`, `cat`, `deer`, `dog`, `frog`, `horse`, `ship`, `truck`

### ðŸ§  Highlights
- Generator and Discriminator implemented using Keras Functional API
- Label embedding to guide generation process
- User input for image class
- Generates realistic fake images

## ðŸŽ¥ Project 2: Object Classification for Automated CCTV

### ðŸ“Œ Objective
Design a CNN-based image classification system to reduce unnecessary CCTV recording by detecting objects (humans, animals, vehicles) and triggering recording only when needed.

### ðŸ“Š Dataset
- Fashion-MNIST: 60,000 grayscale images (28x28)
- CIFAR-10: For concept extension and future deployment

### ðŸ§  Highlights
- Memory-efficient design
- Uses deep learning to identify relevant objects
- Hyperparameter tuning for model improvement
- Evaluated with standard benchmarks
